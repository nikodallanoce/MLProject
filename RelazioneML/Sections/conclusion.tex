\section{Conclusion}
%\textit{What you have drawn} and also:
The project gave us the opportunity to prove what we've learnt during the course, the MONK datasets were extremely useful to understand how the main hyperparameters work and their effects on the learning curves and with the CUP dataset we understood how a grid-search works and how time consuming it is. It was, overall, an important experience for our career and teamwork, in our opinion, was fundamental to overcome any problem that arised during the project.
